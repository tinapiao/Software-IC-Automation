*Special Notes:

        1. Please untar both PDK_CRN65GP_v1.0c_official_IC61_20101010.tar.gz and DOC_PDK_CRN65GP_v1.0c_official_IC61_20101010.tar.gz 
	   before using this PDK.

	2. This PDK support 2.5V IO devices in T-N65-CM-SP-018 model cards. For recognition purpose,
	   this PDK change the 2.5V under-drive 1.8V cell names to *ud18* and 2.5V over-drive 3.3V cell names
	   to *od33*. For example, the baseband 2.5V over-drive 3.3V IO NMOS device is named "nch_25od33" 
	   Please refer to the device description section in this document for detail information.

	3. All the cells included in this PDK are built based on current design 
	   rule documents and spice model cards. Some of rules or parameters may 
	   be changed after this release, please contact TSMC for the most up-to-date information.

	4. Please do not use the devices in "do_not_use" category.

	5. This PDK only provides Calibre DRC/LVS, Assura LVS deck and Calibre/Assura/StarRC RC technology files for 
	   1p6m-4x1z, 1p7m-4x2z and 1p9m-6x1z1u metal options. Please contact TSMC if the other verification tools are preferred.

        6. There is a "TSMC PDK Tools" in the menu bar of CIW. Users need to open any one of cell
           to let Virtuoso load the related skill function in skill directory. Please see the 
	   details in the document "CRN65_CDF_Usage.pdf" in the PDK_doc directory.
	   TSMC provides some utilities in this menu bar:
	   1) Utility to change "OD" layer to "PDIFF" and "NDIFF"
	   2) Utility to change "DFM_options" in MOS CDFs to set "DFM" or "DFM_DRMv13" as default.
	   3) Utility to update all CDFs in the previous design.
	   4) Other tsmc tools. Please refer to the document in PDK_doc for details.

	7. MOS with WPE,Rg effect:
	   1) WPE effect: Netlist generated from PDK contains SCA,SCB,SCC parameters for 
	      Bsim4.5 simulation. For pre-simulation, users can modify these parameters in 
	      MOS CDF form if they are available. For post-simulation, LPE tools will extract
	      SCA,SCB,SCC from layout.
	      * Since there is no implant on native devices, there will be no WPE effect on those devices. 
	        But there are still SCA,SCB,SCC parameters in the netlist of native device. 
		These parameters do not affect simulation result.
	   2) Rg effect: User needs to change the "rgflag" to 1 in model card to enable the
	      Rg effect.   
	   3) Cco effect: User needs to change the "ccoflag" to 1 in model card to enable the
	      Cco effect.

    *** 8  TSMC PDK only support DFM "Action Required rules" and "Analog rules" not include DFM Recommended and Guideline rules.

	9. There is a new DFM option "DFM" in the MOS CDF. User can change the DFM_options
           to "DFM" in the MOS CDF, then the layout of MOS can follow "Action Required rules"
           and "Analog rules" in the design rule version 2.0. Please find the detail in the 
           document "CRN65_CDF_Usage.pdf" in the PDK_doc directory. The DFM option for BB mos 
	   will cover the new recommended rule CO.S.3(R) and CO.EN.1(R) and will not cover PO.S.11 
	   and PO.S.13 in DRM v1.4. To support the new recommended rule(CO.S.3(R) and CO.EN.1(R)) 
	   may cause the shift of all BB mos contact comparing with DFM_DRMv11. Users will need to 
	   fix the possible inter-connect offset issues by themself.

       10. There is a new DFM option "DFM+Analog" in the MOS CDF. User can change the DFM_options
           to "DFM+Analog" in the MOS CDF, then the layout of MOS can follow "Action Required rules"
           and "Analog rules" in the design rule version 1.4.The "DFM+Analog" option for BB mos 
	   will cover the new recommended rule PO.EN.1m,PO.EN.2m and PO.EN.3m in DRM v2.0.

       11. To use the layout of cross-coupled crtmom(crtmom_mx), please follow the instructions shown below to run the 
	   MOM register key utility first.
	   
	       1>Open any cell in tsmcN65 library.
       
       	       2>Click on CIW menu "TSMC PDK Tools"->"tsmcPdkUtilityTool"->"Add MOM license key".
	       
	       3>Select library "tsmcN65" and enter the register key.
	       
	       4>Press "OK" to start the utility.
	       
       12. Two kinds of symbolic contact(s)/via(s) are supported in this release: 
           1) normal symbolics (follow min. rule), ex. M2_M1
           2) DFM symbolics (follow DFM rules) which are named with prefix "DFM", ex. DFM_M2_M1
 
       13. All macro model devices have the (LVSDMY,dummy1) layer on layout for LVS recognition purpose.
 
       14. Users who want to turn-off guarding ring of RF_PMOS. Should be notice that " this layout service is for the cases which 
           there are multi-OD sharing the same BULK pick-up within the same WELL. Therefore, due to the different BULK pick-up and
           WELL boundary, the RC-network and WPE effect will be different. So, designers should remember to handle the model impacts
           from the above effects.

       15. Users who use logic gate devices and run generate from source function to get layout views, it will fail due to no environment setup.
           Please Add "layoutXL lxEvalCDFCallbacks boolean t" in your own .cdsenv

	17. Resistors' entry_mode CDF property was turned off, user can input length & width to change res value
	     or input res value to modify length directly.
	         
    *** 18. The all spiral inductors due to support characteristics of continues models operation. The CRN65 PDK
    	    V1.0b spiral inductors are a little difference from previous version V1.0p2. Uses who use V1.0c PDK to 
    	    design are fine, but the users who have already designed by PDK V1.0p2 and want to transfer to V1.0c 
    	    please pay attentdion to the layout difference of spiral inductors between these two versions. 
    	    TSMC would not take the responsibility if users do not check for these difference or skip the difference. 	

    *** 19. In order to pass the drc violation of "Mx.S.2","Mx.S.2.1","IND.S.2.Mx" and "IND.S.4.Mx" of spiral_sym_ct.
	    The pcell code has been modified, so the layout of spiral_sym_ct may have some difference with CRN65GP
	    PDK version 1.0p2a.

        20. There is a DFM_rule option in the RTMOM CDF. User can set the DFM_rule in the RTMOM,then the layout of 
	    RTMOM can follow "Action Required rules". But will violate DFM RR:RE:D:MxS1 and RR:GL:SP:NWR1.RD team has
	    two comments."1.If customers want to create DFM free layout,please choose sp>=0.13um(Mx.S.1) to follow DFM rule"
	    "2.When choose NW option for RTMOM,there might cause floating NW DFM violation,customers can add NW pick
	    up to solve this violation."

        21. TSMC SPICE team suggests that customers use "_mac" model for their noise figure simulation.

	22. Turn on the poly-route function when finger number equal to 1, poly contact will add on automatically.
	
        23. Spiral inductors/crtmom_rf don't support back-annotation function. The TIF/TCF already calculate the L/C value.

        24. In CRN65GP_V1.0C PDK, the scale parameter default supplied is set to 1 and user should not change it in PDK.
       
	25. There is a DFM_rule option in the RTMOM CDF. User can set the DFM_rule in the RTMOM,then the layout of 
            RTMOM can follow "Action Required rules". But will violate DFM RR:RE:D:MxS1 and RR:GL:SP:NWR1.RD team has
            two comments."1.If customers want to create DFM free layout,please choose sp>=0.13um(Mx.S.1) to follow DFM rule"
            "2.When choose NW option for RTMOM,there might cause floating NW DFM violation,customers should add NW pick
            up manully to solve this violation."

        26. All devices may has different value between spice and spectre model card in simulation result.   
 
        27. Take special care for DRC when switching off the impLayer option in all base band mos device layout.

     ** 28. Users need to pay attentdion to switch off guard ring in RF device, because guard ring is for RF device LVS recognition purpose. 

        29. Due to the complex of metal resistor models(model varies with width and spacing), the metal resistors 'rm*' are always modeled as 
            'rm*w' in PDK which mayn't reflect the real situations.

        30. There are DRC violations of rule NT_N.A.1 when using native nmos with minimum size and rule RPO.A.1 when using resistors with minimum size.
            Users may need to take care this layout manually if the minimum size is used.

        31. In Assura dfII flow, the npn/npn_mis and pnp/pnp_mis will have multi-to-multi binding issue. To avoid this issue
            LVS deck do not support npn and pnp device for Assura dfII flow. Users need to switch them manually if necessary.

        32. Please do not use "m" for mismatch BJT multi parameter due to model do not support mismatch equation for multi.
            Users need to use them for one(m=1) device in netlist for mismatch simulation. 

        33. Please do not use too large size (ex.850u*850u,width and length are over 150um) of base band mos, it will cause drc violation 
	    for too high density.

    *** 34. Currently, all Assura/Calibre/Star_rc RC decks do not support mimcap extraction.
	    If customers need mimcap(cbm and ctm) extraction, please make request to TSMC.

        35. A DRC violation of rule NT_N.A.1 is found when using native nmos with minimum size. Users may need to fix
	    this layout manually if the minimum size is used.

        36. Please be careful to use the base band mimcap (mimcap and mimcap_udc). It will cause drc violations (max. CBM width) 
            if the CTM width and the number of CTM array are too large.

        37. If users use resistor contact number with zero, please take care the metal connection in series or parallel.

        38. The parameter of "area_Length/area_Width" in TIF are not exactly accurate. 

        39. This version of PDK includes some new spectre primitive "bsource",only 5.10.41.169 or later can support AMS back-annotation option. 

	40. For device nch_na, pdk cell follows the L/W min/max range defined in the model card, but some dimension may not supported in 
            the nch_na bin models, such as L=2.0E-7/W=9.0E-4, please check the model carefully. PDK limits the mim. length to L=3.0E-7 to 
            safely run the simulation of model card. If user really need to run min length L=2.0E-7, user can turn off the HardConstrain in 
            CDF of nch_na device.


** Known Problem: 
     
      1. crtmom_mx, mimcap_woum_rf, pmoscap_rf25, pmoscap_rf, moscap_rf25, moscap_rf25_nw, moscap_rf
         moscap_rf_nw, nmos_rf_25, nmos_rf_25_nodnw, nmos_rf_25_nodnwod33, nmos_rf_25_nodnwud18
         nmos_rf_25od33, nmos_rf_25ud18, nmos_rf, nmos_rf_nodnw, pmos_rf_25, pmos_rf_25_nw
         pmos_rf_25_nwod33, pmos_rf_25_nwud18, pmos_rf_25od33, pmos_rf_25ud18, pmos_rf, pmos_rf_nw, rppoly_rf
         rppolywo_rf, xjvar, xjvar_nw
         Above devices will violate PO.DN.3 , DRM will solve this issue in next version.

      2. Baseband mos in specific parameter combination will result pcell failure as below.
         (1)width 125n,135n or 145n with routePolydir Both option.
         (2)two fingers and route_Source_Drain layout function without contacts.             
         (3)dog-bone structure will make drc violation due to adjacent edges with length less than minimum width is not allowed
         These issues will be fixed in next version.
                   

      3. Please do not use layout function "fingers_SP_INC"(finger space) equal to 5 nm with 5 nm unit width.
         It will cause 5nm shift of layout in minRule and drc violation in DFM/DFM+Analog rule.

      4. Please do not re-install PDK after use fold & chain utlity. The install program will fail due to redundant device generation after using 
         fold & chain utlity. Cadence will fix the issue later. 
      
      5. Base band mos in specific CDF parameter value combination such as finger equal two, DFM layout mode, polyDir switch on
         and body_tie detached will cause pcell failure. 

      6. There are some known issues of drc deck(T-N65-CL-DR-001-C1 VER 2.0a ) as below.
         1) Latch-up connect : connection issue(false alarm)
         2) VTH_N.S.3, VTH_P.S.3, VTL_N.S.3, VTL_P.S.3 rules : checking issue(false alarm) 
         3) VAR.W.1 and VAR.W.4 rules : partial missing checking issue(missing) 
         DRC team will fix these issues later.

      7. The parameter of "area_Length/area_Width" in TIF/TCF are not exactly accurate.

      8. Back annotation function of DC operating point does not work for resistor with segments >1. The
         function only exist on segment =1 condition of resistor.
         And back annotation function of DC operating point does not work for resistor with series. 
         The function only support for parallel condition of resistors.
  
      9. V1.0B PDK solve the Cadence tool's issue of hspiceD current probing
	   problem. Users can get hot-fix tool version from Cadence site. But this
	   hot-fix tool will have some issue in output Diode netlis such as :
               dnwpsub	ndio	ndio_25	ndio_25od33	ndio_25ud18
	       ndio_esd	 ndio_hvt	ndio_lvt	ndio_mlvt
	       ndio_na	 ndio_na25	nwdio		pdio
	       pdio_25	 pdio_25od33	pdio_25ud18	pdio_hvt
 	       pdio_lvt	 pdio_mlvt	pwdnw
	       ndio_na25od33	
	   Tsmc will request Cadence to solve this tool issue in their hot-fix version.
     
     10. Spiral_sym_ct type inductors TIF limits the max turn equal to five. This max turn will extend to six for user 
         and model bigger range. We will extend this model range in later release version.

     11. Please do not use the rfmos with finger=1 and dummy poly =nil because the drain drawing will shift.
         TSMC will fix the pcell in next version.

     12. The SA,SB,NRS,NRD parameters may be wrong when the MOS device becomes a dog-bone structure.
	 The "nrd" and "nrs" values in pre-sim netlist (calculated by PDK) are calculated with the distance from S/D contact 
	 to gate (more accuracy) while they are calculated from S/D edge to gate in RC decks(due to tool limitation). 
	 Thus, the "nrs" and "nrd" values in pre-sim netlist are more accuracy than post-sim netlist.
