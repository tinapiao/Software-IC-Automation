- Revision history
        01/16/06   1.0c_pre011606 Y.T.Pu
	           Added the new WPE for BSIM4.5
        01/25/06   V1.0pc1_pre012506 Y.T.Pu
                   Removing the extracted WPE of SRAM when turns on "RC_DECK" without 
                   turning on "DFM_RULE".
        02/15/06   N65G DFM updated to v0.2.
	           1)The file variable_file under the DFM_G directory is v0.2,
		     and the file variable_file_v0.1 under the DFM_G directory 
		     is v0.1.
		   2)Updated the logic_operation for suppressing the wrong extracted 
		     NRD/NRS when the gate width directory is horizontal.
        03/01/06   1)To re-product this deck by following the file "LPE_extraction_offering_table.ppt"
	             to extract the relative parameters of all the MOS.
		   2)Added the option "extracte_dnwdio" for extracting the DNW diode.  
        
	03/28/06   N65G DFM updated to v1.0.
	           1) Stack gate parameters has been set to zero.		 
        05/1706    1) Added two devices "nch_dnw_1tr" and "nch_ulvt" for 1TRam team requested. 
                   2) Updated the DFM size gate then to "AND" with gate for suppressing 
                      SA and SB issue.		   
	06/30/2006 1) Added two devices "nch_dnw_1tr" and "nch_ulvt" for 1TRam team requested. 
                   2) Updated the DFM size gate then to "AND" with diffusion layer for suppressing 
                      SA and SB issue. 
                   3) Mapping device name to the spice model name when the DFM_RULE switch turn on.
		   4) Added CBD layer (169). The AP via layer is (RV OR CBD)	      
		   5) Added G+ process version 0.01
        10/16/2006 Yating Chuang
	           1) Refine DFM S/D regions.
		   2) Add BY SHAPE option when DFM is turn on.
		   3) Ehance DFM LPE parameters. 
        11/09/2006 Yating Chuang
	           1) Calibrate OD/PO rounding length in U shape OD/PO. 
        02/20/2008 Y.J.Wang 		   
	           1) Hercules DFM macro update for tndiff_new/tpdiff_new calculation.
        05/15/2008 Y.J.Wang 
	           1) Assura DFM macro update of OD/PO edge for calculating rounding effect.		   
        06/20/2008 Y.J.Wang
	 	   1) Modify Calibre/Assura DFM macro for reduce running time.
        09/30/2009 Y.J.Wang
		   1) Modify Calibre DFM macro that use DFM PROPERTY function to implement rounding effects.
		   2) Update Calibre decks for WPE/LOD effect to newest TVF function procedures.
		   3) Remove BY SHAPE command in Calibre deck for DFM effect. 
	11/20/2009 Y.J.Wang
	           1) Modify Calibre TVF function for WPE effect in switch STD_LIB_9_TRACK / STD_LIB_11_TRACK on.
