Note1: Metal2~Metal7 = Mx, Metal8 = Mz, Metal9 = Mu, Metal10 = AlRDL. 

Note2:
    The QAreport.1x_10x is the QA results of patterns with width = 1x ~ 10x minimum width,
    spacing = 1x ~ 10x minimum spacing, and number of facing to above and below layer = 2.
    The QAreport.allpattern_error10 is the QA results of all patterns with capacitance or 
    resistance errors more than 10 percent.
    The QAreport.analog combines the QA results of all patterns with spacing = 1x ~ 5x and
    6x ~ 10x minimum spacing.

Note3:
    Use the Unix command 'cat' to combine these two files into a newrule file, and rename the new rule file "rules".
    % cat *.res >> rules
