Tutorial
========

This section contains several simple tutorials for you to get an idea of the BAG workflow.

In these tutorials, we will be using :program:`git` extensively.  git allows you to copy a working setup,
and it also allows you to checkout and use other people's design while they can work on adding future
improvements.  To learn git, you can read the documentations here_, or alternatively you can just
google git commands to learn more about it while working through the tutorial.
